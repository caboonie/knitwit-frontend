# Knitwit Frontend

Knitwit uses Node.js and Node express to serve pages and create Routes. Also uses JWT with Node to keep track of user state.

React components are used to render pages, specifically a spreadsheet of knitting stitches that user can color according to a knitting pattern. Patterns are saved intermitendly by posting the state to python Flask app on knitwit-backend.
